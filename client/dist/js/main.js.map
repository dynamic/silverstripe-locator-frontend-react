@author Gary Little\n * @fileoverview\n * The library creates and manages per-zoom-level clusters for large amounts of markers.\n * <p>\n * This is an enhanced V3 implementation of the\n * <a href=\"http://gmaps-utility-library-dev.googlecode.com/svn/tags/markerclusterer/\"\n * >V2 MarkerClusterer</a> by Xiaoxi Wu. It is based on the\n * <a href=\"http://google-maps-utility-library-v3.googlecode.com/svn/tags/markerclusterer/\"\n * >V3 MarkerClusterer</a> port by Luke Mahe. MarkerClustererPlus was created by Gary Little.\n * <p>\n * v2.0 release: MarkerClustererPlus v2.0 is backward compatible with MarkerClusterer v1.0. It\n *  adds support for the <code>ignoreHidden</code>, <code>title</code>, <code>batchSizeIE</code>,\n *  and <code>calculator</code> properties as well as support for four more events. It also allows\n *  greater control over the styling of the text that appears on the cluster marker. The\n *  documentation has been significantly improved and the overall code has been simplified and\n *  polished. Very large numbers of markers can now be managed without causing Javascript timeout\n *  errors on Internet Explorer. Note that the name of the <code>clusterclick</code> event has been\n *  deprecated. The new name is <code>click</code>, so please change your application code now.\n */\n\n/**\n * Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n * you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n * You may obtain a copy of the License at\n *\n *     http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n *\n * Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n * distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n * WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n * See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n * limitations under the License.\n */\n\n\n/**\n * @name ClusterIconStyle\n * @class This class represents the object for values in the <code>styles</code> array passed\n *  to the {@link MarkerClusterer} constructor.

(Alternatively, you can use a custom <code>calculator</code> function to specify a\n *  different tooltip for each cluster marker.)\n * @property {function} [calculator=MarkerClusterer.CALCULATOR] The function used to determine\n *  the text to be displayed on a cluster marker and the index indicating which style to use\n *  for the cluster marker. The input parameters for the function are (1) the array of markers\n *  represented by a cluster marker and (2) the number of cluster icon styles. It returns a\n *  {@link ClusterIconInfo} object. The default <code>calculator</code> returns a\n *  <code>text</code> property which is the number of markers in the cluster and an\n *  <code>index</code> property which is one higher than the lowest integer such that\n *  <code>10^i</code> exceeds the number of markers in the cluster, or the size of the styles\n *  array, whichever is less. The <code>styles</code> array element used has an index of\n *  <code>index</code> minus 1. For example, the default <code>calculator</code> returns a\n *  <code>text</code> value of <code>\"125\"</code> and an <code>index</code> of <code>3</code>\n *  for a cluster icon representing 125 markers so the element used in the <code>styles</code>\n *  array is <code>2</code>. A <code>calculator</code> may also return a <code>title</code>\n *  property that contains the text of the tooltip to be used for the cluster marker. If\n *   <code>title</code> is not defined, the tooltip is set to the value of the <code>title</code>\n *   property for the MarkerClusterer.\n * @property {string} [clusterClass=\"cluster\"] The name of the CSS class defining general styles\n *  for the cluster markers. Use this class to define CSS styles that are not set up by the code\n *  that processes the <code>styles</code> array.\n * @property {Array} [styles] An array of {@link ClusterIconStyle} elements defining the styles\n *  of the cluster markers to be used. The element to be used to style a given cluster marker\n *  is determined by the function defined by the <code>calculator</code> property.\n *  The default is an array of {@link ClusterIconStyle} elements whose properties are derived\n *  from the values for <code>imagePath</code>, <code>imageExtension</code>, and\n *  <code>imageSizes</code>.\n * @property {boolean} [enableRetinaIcons=false] Whether to allow the use of cluster icons that\n * have sizes that are some multiple (typically double) of their actual display size. Icons such\n * as these look better when viewed on high-resolution monitors such as Apple's Retina displays.\n * Note: if this property is <code>true</code>, sprites cannot be used as cluster icons.\n * @property {number} [batchSize=MarkerClusterer.BATCH_SIZE] Set this property to the\n *  number of markers to be processed in a single batch when using a browser other than\n *  Internet Explorer (for Internet Explorer, use the batchSizeIE property instead).\n * @property {number} [batchSizeIE=MarkerClusterer.BATCH_SIZE_IE] When Internet Explorer is\n *  being used, markers are processed in several batches with a small delay inserted between\n *  each batch in an attempt to avoid Javascript timeout errors. Set this property to the\n *  number of markers to be processed in a single batch; select as high a number as you can\n *  without causing a timeout error in the browser. This number might need to be as low as 100\n *  if 15,000 markers are being managed, for example.\n * @property {string} [imagePath=MarkerClusterer.IMAGE_PATH]\n *  The full URL of the root name of the group of image files to use for cluster icons.\n *  The complete file name is of the form <code>imagePath</code>n.<code>imageExtension</code>\n *  where n is the image file number (1, 2, etc.).\n * @property {string} [imageExtension=MarkerClusterer.IMAGE_EXTENSION]\n *  The extension name for the cluster icon image files (e.g., <code>\"png\"</code> or\n *  <code>\"jpg\"</code>).\n * @property {Array} [imageSizes=MarkerClusterer.IMAGE_SIZES]\n *  An array of numbers containing the widths of the group of\n *  <code>imagePath</code>n.<code>imageExtension</code> image files.\n *  (The images are assumed to be square.)\n */\n/**\n * Creates a MarkerClusterer object with the options specified in {@link MarkerClustererOptions}.\n * @constructor\n * @extends google.maps.OverlayView\n * @param {google.maps.Map} map The Google map to attach to.\n * @param {Array.<google.maps.Marker>} [opt_markers] The markers to be added to the cluster.\n * @param {MarkerClustererOptions} [opt_options] The optional parameters.\n */\nfunction MarkerClusterer(map, opt_markers, opt_options) {\n  // MarkerClusterer implements google.maps.OverlayView interface.
